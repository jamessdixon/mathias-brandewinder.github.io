# Welcome!

You have found my blog - congratulations :)

The content is mine; The infrastructure, however, is Hyde. Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Huge thanks to the author, **Mark Otto**, for all the work:
