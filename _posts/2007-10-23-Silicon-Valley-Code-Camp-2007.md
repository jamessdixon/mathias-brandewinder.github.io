The schedule of <a href="http://siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Default.aspx" title="Silicon Valley Code Camp 2007">Silicon Valley Code 
Camp 2007</a> is now official. Code Camp is a free conference by and for 
the developer community. Speakers volunteer their time and everyone attends for 
free. It&#39;s a place to learn, to network and to dig into some 
code. <a href="http://siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?OnlyOne=true&amp;amp;id=140">My 
session</a> is scheduled on Saturday, October 27, at 5:15; I will be 
giving a talk on a subject dear to me, Test Driven Development, in C#, using 
NUnit. I will of course try to Test-Drive the session, which means writing some 
code live; this is always a perilous exercise - but that is also what is 
fun! I am also looking forward checking out the other sessions. The 
line-up this year is great; there are quite a few speakers I have seen and 
enjoyed through Bay.Net (Juwal Loewy, Chris Mullins, Deborah Kurata, Beth 
Massi... ), and some I have not seen yet, but with great session topics.
