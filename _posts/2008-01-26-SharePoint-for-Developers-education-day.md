The next [Bay.Net education day](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=151587) 
is now officially announced! It will take place on February 16th, 2008, from
9am to 4pm, and will be hosted in the OakRoom at HP in Cupertino; for a tiny registration
of $35, [Lynn Langit](http://blogs.msdn.com/socaldevgal/), Microsoft Evangelist,
will be telling you everything you need to know about SharePoint, and probably even
a bit more. Judging by what I know from Lynn, it should be a top-notch, fun, and high-energy
session. Hope to see you there! Did I mention that I was involved with the organization?
