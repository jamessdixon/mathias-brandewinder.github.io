If you always wondered what life is like in a start-up (maybe before starting your own?), "[Start-up junkies](http://www.hulu.com/start-up-junkies)" might just be the show for you. It is a documentary which chronicles the growth of a real Seattle-based start-up, "[Earth-Class Mail](http://www.earthclassmail.com/)", in 24-minutes installments. Earth Class Mail's vision is to deliver your postal mail through the web. I have watched 3 episodes so far, and found it pretty entertaining to watch. It was especially interesting to me, because it provided a window into two aspects I haven't experienced, even though I spent the previous five years working in [a start-up in the silicon valley](http://www.appliedstrategies.com). Applied Strategies was fully self-funded, so it never had to go through the whole VC funding mating dance - and after watching it unfold, I am glad it didn't... The other aspect I enjoy is the click-and-mortar nature of their business, which mixes cutting-edge technology with old-school artifacts like giant mail warehouses; it introduces a nice extra level of complexity: adjusting a software prototype is way easier than modifying the way a physical "factory" operates!
