Just thought I would point out [this page at Acaso Analytics](http://www.owlstonenanotech.com/temp/InteractiveSCurveMathias.html), where Billy Boyle used my previous post on [how to use a simple S-shaped curve to model the introduction of a new product on a market](http://brandewinder.com/2008/06/08/S-shaped-market-adoption-curve/), and created a very cool interactive dashboard which illustrates how the curve looks like, and what happens to it when the parameters change. I am a big fan of quantitative models, and enjoyed his other posts as well, which are an eclectic collection of "illustrated" famous quantitative models. Nothing tells the story behind a mathematical model better than a good chart, or, better, an interactive one!
