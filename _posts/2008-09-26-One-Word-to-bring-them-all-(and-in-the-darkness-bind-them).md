I just wanted to share this solid post by Joel Spolsky on [password management](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/09/11b.html). Like most people, I know that it's bad to use the same password for multiple places, and that you should change them regularly; like most people too, I am totally convinced of that, and yet I do just what I shouldn't, because remembering many passwords is just a pain, especially if it's a long and human-unreadable password. The problem is compounded if you work from multiple machines, and need to access online services from them, in which case the temptation of using a few generic passwords increases quite a bit. Well, the solution Joel proposes addresses that, and I just made all my sensitive passwords completely human-unreadable; on top of that, I even used the option to make me change them every 3 months. Woot! It's nice when technology makes doing the right thing easy...
