Silicon Valley [Code Camp 2008](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com) is coming soon now! Both my sessions have been officially scheduled for Saturday November 8, room 4201 in Foothill College. I will be giving an introduction to Test-Driven Development for C# developers at 3:45, and showing how to build an Excel 2003/2007 add-in using VSTO at 5:15. I am pretty excited about it, and hope that I'll still have enough energy left in me to visit some of the other talks. By the way, feel free to make requests on what you want me to cover (or to avoid!) in the comments, or in the Code Camp wiki!
