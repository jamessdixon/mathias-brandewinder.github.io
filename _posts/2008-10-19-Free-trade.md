In its October issue, Wired has a short interview of the economist [Jagdish Bhagwati](http://www.wired.com/politics/law/magazine/16-10/sl_bhagwati), on free trade. I enjoyed his point that most of the free-trade discourse focuses on free-trade agreements which are ultimately large protectionist blocks, and ignores the idea of IP free-trade.
