I have been a bit frustrated by the sometimes erratic behavior of the code formatter that ships with Blogengine.Net. It works well for C# code, but I still couldn't figure out why it totally garbled my attempt at VB code. So I was happy to see a post from a credible source titled "[Best Code Syntax Highlighter for Snippets in your Blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BestCodeSyntaxHighlighterForSnippetsInYourBlog.aspx). Turns out, after looking at the comments, I am not convinced yet I have found the Holy Grail of code formatting, but on the other hand, it triggered me to try out Windows Live Writer; and indeed, Hanselman has a point - why haven't I used it before? It's just so much more comfortable!
