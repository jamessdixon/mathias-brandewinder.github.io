## Event Description 

This all day training event is designed to teach developers how to create WPF Line of Business Applications that can easily be Unit Tested. The Model-View-ViewModel (M-V-VM) pattern will be used as a guideline for the application structure. Many aspects of WPF LOB programming will be covered including validation, logging, UI entry error notification, exception handling, layered application architecture, Unit Testing and a short introduction to memory profiling. At the end of the day, developers should have a good grasp on M-V-VM and how to create their own testable WPF LOB applications.  

For the lab time, we will provide an application walkthrough that attendees can complete during the lab time. Walkthrough will be in C# and VB.NET. Additionally, if you have a current WPF application and want to move it to M-V-VM bring it with you on your laptop. You can get started on the project during the lab. This way you'll have hands on help to get to up and running.
