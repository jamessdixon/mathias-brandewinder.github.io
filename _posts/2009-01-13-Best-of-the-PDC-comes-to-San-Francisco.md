If you missed this year's Microsoft Professional Developer Conference (like me) and live in the San Francisco area, you got a second chance. On February 23rd, the MSDN Developer Conference (MDC) will deliver the core message, content, and experience of the PDC in a one-day, multi-track event. Cloud computing, Azure, Live Mesh, WPF 4.0, Silverlight, Parallel Programming... all the latest bleeding-edge stuff will be there - and you'll even get a free copy of Windows 7 Beta! More on the event [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/brunoterkaly/archive/2009/01/11/msdn-developer-conference-feb-23rd-in-san-francisco.aspx), and [registration info here](http://www.msdndevcon.com/Pages/sanfrancisco.aspx).
