We had a full house at the [Bay.Net](http://baynetug.org) education day this Saturday in Cupertino - 150 attendees, with people coming from as far as Utah, Wisconsin and Mexico. [Karl Shifflett](http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/) and [Jaime Rodriguez](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaimer/) gave a talk on building Line of Business applications with WPF using Model-View-View Model. Judging by the survey, this was a success! Logistics were a bit stressful, as this was the first time we organized a lab on such a scale, but things went rather smoothly. Thanks to HP for providing a great venue, and especially to Mamoun for making this possible!
