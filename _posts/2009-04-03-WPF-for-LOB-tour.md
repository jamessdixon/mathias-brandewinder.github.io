Since [Karl Shifflett](http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/) and [Jaime Rodriguez](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaimer/) came to the Bay Area for a [Bay.Net](http://www.baynetug.org) [education day]({{ site.url }}}/2009/02/04/Full-house-at-Karl-Shiffletts-education-day/) on how to build line of business apps with WPF using Model-View-ViewModel, I have been regularly checking out their blogs, and I was very excited to learn that they are taking it on a [world tour](http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/announcing-the-wpf-for-lob-training-tour/)! If it happens in an area near you, don't miss it; it was one of our most successful events to date, and it's totally worth it.
