title: Moderate unapproved comments with Commentor

If you are using Blogengine.Net, and struggle to moderate comments, you should check out [Commentor](http://rtur.net/blog/post/2009/02/16/Commentor-e28093-new-version.aspx)
<a href="http://rtur.net/blog/post/2009/02/16/Commentor-e28093-new-version.aspx">Commentor</a>, an extension by [rtur.net](http://rtur.net/blog/)
<a href="http://rtur.net/blog/">rtur.net</a>. The lack of comment moderation tools in the Blogengine admin section is one of its weaknesses, especially when you compare it to WordPress. Commentor addresses that problem, by providing one page where you can manage all the comments, including the new comments awaiting approval. Thank you, great job!
