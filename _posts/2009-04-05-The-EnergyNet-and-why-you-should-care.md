The Legendary [Juval Lowy](http://idesign.net/idesign/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=3&tabid=5) will conduct a free half-day seminar introducing the EnergyNet. The EnergyNet is a massive new software system analogous to the Internet, transferring watts and usage data instead of packets and request, connecting anything and everything in the energy market. He will demonstrate why software developers should care and how they can become engaged in this exciting new field, and point out the skills and expertise required for those that want to not only survive but thrive on the next boom in software.  

This should be a great event. Juval is an amazing speaker, and I havenâ€™t heard him being so fired up about something since a while!
