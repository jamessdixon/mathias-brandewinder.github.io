Through the twitter feed of [Tim O’Reilly](http://twitter.com/timoreilly), I came across this great [post](http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/04/march-network-flow-algorithms.html) on network flow algorithms. Not only did I have fun revisiting the Min Cut / Max Flow, but there was a great link to an [article](http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MCISE.2000.814652) listing the “10 algorithms with the greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century”. I am very excited, as for a few of them, I have absolutely no idea what they are about; it has always fascinated me to see the isolation of research fields, and how much they don’t know about each other.   

Here is the official list:  

> Metropolis Algorithm for Monte Carlo     
> Simplex Method for Linear Programming     
> Krylov Subspace Iteration Methods     
> The Decompositional Approach to Matrix Computations    
> The Fortran Optimizing Compiler    
> QR Algorithm for Computing Eigenvalues    
> Quicksort Algorithm for Sorting    
> Fast Fourier Transform    
> Integer Relation Detection    
> Fast Multipole Method 

Which ones do you know? And how did you come across them?
