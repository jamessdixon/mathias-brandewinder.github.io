Via [Andew Gelman](Andrew Gelman), a really cool [text visualization](http://www.textarc.org/) project. It might or might not be insightful, but it’s beautiful, and the guys who put this together have really made this very cool – you can see the entire text of Alice in Wonderland scroll, simultaneously plotting the word relationships as the story progresses. Amazing.
