Since the longest time, I have been a member of [Bay.Net](http://baynetug.org), the San Francisco Bay Area .NET user group. It’s one of the largest user groups in the country (north of 4,000 members), very active, with four chapters in the Bay – and first and foremost, it’s a fantastic way to keep up with what is going on in the ever-changing .NET world, and meet fellow developers and fun people.  

I initially came to attend the meetings, started to get more involved and volunteering in organizing events (if you are interested in volunteering, drop me a line!) – and I was very honored to be offered to co-chair the San Francisco chapter. The current chair, [Kim Greenlee](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kim-greenlee/1/476/407), has been doing an amazing job at lining up great speaker after another, and making the meetings fun to attend, but she wants to dedicate her energy to another Bay.Net related project, and can’t be full-time chair anymore, so… the pressure is on – I’ll do my best to keep it up!
