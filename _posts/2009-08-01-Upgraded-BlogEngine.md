I have been slammed with work lately, and couldn’t find the time to do this, even though I have wanted to for a while. Well, it’s done – this blog now runs on BlogEngine.Net 1.5.1.14! One of the reasons I wanted to give it a try is the [multiple-widget zone](http://allben.net/post/2009/04/18/Multiple-WidgetZones-in-BENET.aspx) feature, which is unfortunately not yet in the 1.5 “official” release, so I went the adventurous route, and here we are! I still need to do some minor polishing on the styling in the next few days, but so far, everything looks like it’s running smoothly.
