It’s that time of the year again: [Silicon Valley Code Camp](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Default.aspx) is coming up on October 3rd and 4th, at Foothill College. If you live in the Bay Area and like to talk code, this is an event you don’t want to miss. The previous editions rocked, and this year looks like it’s going to rock even harder, with well over 100 sessions and close to 1,000 registered! Oh, and did I mention it’s free?  This year again, I will give an introduction to [Test-Driven Development](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?id=163) for .NET developers. It’s a topic which is dear to my heart; in his book on TDD, [Kent Beck](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) says that it “is a way of managing fear during programming”, and I have to say that my life as a developer got significantly more peaceful after reading it. I can’t guarantee that you will feel the same, but I’ll do my best to share the goods!  The session is targeted for beginners. My goal is to get you quick-started so that you are ready to use it when you leave the room. I will write some code live, to show the methodology in action, using only tools you can get for free. This year, I think I will focus mostly on NUnit and keep it to a minimum on the tools provided in Visual Studio, unless there is strong popular demand; hopefully this will give me enough time to squeeze in a few minutes on mocks. I also just ordered Roy Osherove’s “[The Art of Unit Testing](http://www.manning.com/osherove/), which looks very promising, and may push me to modify my plan a bit.  I hope to see you there – and if you have questions or suggestions, let me know in the comments section!
