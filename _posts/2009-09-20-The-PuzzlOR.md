I was recently inspired by an article in OR/MS mag to write 2 posts on using [Excel data tables](http://{{ site.url }}/2009/09/03/More-What-If-analysis-with-Excel-Data-Table) to [resolve optimization problems]({{ site.url}} /2009/08/28/Find-an-optimal-solution-with-Excel-Data-Table). As it turns out, these puzzles are not only published in the magazine: they also have their online home at [Puzzlor.com](http://puzzlor.com/). So if you like optimization and math problems in general, and like puzzles, check it out!
