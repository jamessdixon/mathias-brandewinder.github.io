[How to value life](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1609) is a thorny [issue for economists](http://www.amazon.com/Priceless-Knowing-Price-Everything-Nothing/dp/1565848500) and non-economists, but I hadnâ€™t expected the question to be also a matter of lively discussion among dinosaurs. And considering the state of decision theory at the time, they do a pretty good job at it.
