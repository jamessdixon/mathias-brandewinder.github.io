We software engineers like to overbuild at times. I have seen some traffic increase on this blog, sure, but nothing that the current xml backend can’t handle. On the other hand, hey, in case I see a 100-fold increase in the near future, then I’ll be happier if I have something more robust already in place, so I just followed [Al Nyveldt’s tutorial](http://www.nyveldt.com/blog/page/BlogEngineNET-Provider-Migration.aspx) and swapped to a MS SQL back-end – it went smoothly overall, but I apologize if any of you experienced some glitchy stuff!
