I will be presenting “For Those About to Mock” on Tuesday, January 19th at the [North Bay .Net user group](http://www.baynetug.org/DesktopModules/DetailXEvents.aspx?ItemID=410&mid=49) in Sebastopol – and I am very excited about it, because it is my first time in this user group, and because I really enjoy the topic. As a long-time fan of TDD, I came across mocking a long time ago, but it took me a while to incorporate it in my daily code, not really because it’s complicated, but rather, because I didn’t quite understand what issue mocking frameworks were solving. Also, explanations on the topic are often fairly intimidating.   

My goal will be to spare you the misunderstandings I went through, so that you understand where mocking can help you, and how to use frameworks like Rhino.Mocks and Moq in your own code. Hope to see you there, and if you have specific requests or questions you would want me to address, please let me know in the comments!
