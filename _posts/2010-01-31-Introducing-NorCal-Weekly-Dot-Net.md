I have grown a bit frustrated by the difficulty to gather information about local .Net development community events. Of all people, I am one of the best-positioned to hear about these events, because of my involvement with the San Francisco .Net user group, and yet, I routinely discover that I missed an event, because there is no clear place to go to get that information and I never heard about it.

So here we go - ladies and gentlemen, introducing [NorCalWeekly.Net](http://norcalweekly.net), your weekly serving of .Net events in north California! My goal will be to provide in one place, on a weekly basis, announcements for all upcoming .Net events in the area - so if you know of anything relevant taking place, please let me know! The design and features are somewhat minimalist for the moment, I'll improve it over time.
