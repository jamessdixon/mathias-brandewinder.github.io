Finally performed the upgrade to BlogEngine 1.6.0. I apologize to my readers who may have experienced outages - the process wasn't quite as smooth as for the previous versions, in part due to the documentation, which was less thorough than usual. Thanks to David Wynne for his [step-by-step walkthrough](http://www.david-wynne.com/blog/post/Upgrading-BlogEngineNET-from-15-to-16.aspx) which came in very handy. I would also have appreciated if somewhere, it was mentioned that the database schema had been slightly modified...
