I am pretty excited that the new [Silverlight Toolkit](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/) now [supports Stacked Series](http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/archive/2010/04/16/the-one-with-all-the-goofy-heading-names-detailed-information-about-the-silverlight-toolkit-s-new-stacked-series-support.aspx). If you develop business applications, at some point or another, you will have to produce charts. A while back I looked into the WPF / Silverlight toolkit, which offers charting capabilities, and I really liked it, because its design supports mvvm-style databinding pretty well. There was one major drawback, though: it didn’t include any stacked series. The point of reference for most business users is Excel charts, and this left a large chunk of the standard charts out. Problem solved with the last release: the stacked histogram and some of his friends are in! The [Excel “Outdoors Bar” type]({{ site.url}}/2009/08/03/Create-Excel-Line-Column-Chart-from-C/) is still not included, but I don’t think anyone will complain. I can’t wait to play with this release.
