I gave a lightning talk on [Pex](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/) at the [San Francisco .Net user group](http://baynetug.org) this Wednesday, and figured I might as well post the slide deck. Pex is a fascinating free add-in to Visual Studio, totally worth looking into: unleash Pex on a method, and it will identify interesting input values for you.
