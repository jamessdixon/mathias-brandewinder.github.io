First, my sincere apologies if you have been experiencing some strange behavior when trying to comment on this blog in the past few days – like maybe an unfriendly pop-up message talking some nonsense about a callback error while processing the comment.   

You may have noticed that below the form for the comment, there is now a beautiful, brand new and shiny [ReCaptcha](http://recaptcha.net/) control, which is included out of the box with [release 1.6.1 of Blogengine.Net](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/post/BlogEngine-161-Update.aspx). Thanks to [Filip Stanek](http://www.bloodforge.com/) for contributing his [ReCaptcha extension](http://www.bloodforge.com/post/BlogengineNET-reCaptcha-093-Installation-Instructions.aspx) to the project, and to the [awesome development team](http://blogengine.codeplex.com/team/view) for including this out-of-the-box. Until now, spam handling has been a major weakness of BlogEngine.Net, and was turning into a serious annoyance for me. Since the upgrade, the spammers’ [evil plans have run into a wall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs4quhTO4WU), and it suddenly feels very lonely in here, without all the kind words of encouragement:  

> Intimately, the post is in reality the freshest on this valuable topic. I harmonise with your conclusions and will thirstily look forward to your future updates. Just saying thanks will not just be sufficient, for the exceptional clarity in your writing.

Special thanks (Grazie mille!) to [Andrea Dottor](http://blog.dottor.net/) who came to the rescue with a [fix for the error message](http://blogengine.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=208271&ANCHOR#Post435824) mentioned above.
