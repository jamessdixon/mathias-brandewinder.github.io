I gave a quick Firestarter talk at the [San Francisco .Net user group](http://baynetug.org) yesterday about [.less](http://www.dotlesscss.com/). .less ("dot-less") is an open source .Net library, which extends the functionality of CSS (it works with your existing CSS files), adding features like variables, using a syntax close to CSS. If you find that [working with CSS](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/whats-wrong-with-css.html) causes some teeth-grinding , you should probably have a look!
