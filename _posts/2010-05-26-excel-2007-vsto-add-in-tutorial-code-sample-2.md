I finally got to reviewing and scrubbing the code for the part 2 of my Excel 2007 VSTO tutorial; you can [download the code here](http://clear-lines.com/wiki/Anakin.ashx). Next chapter, we will venture into the joys of deployment.   

In the meanwhile, please feel free to let me know in the comments what you think, like and dislike, and how I can make this better!
