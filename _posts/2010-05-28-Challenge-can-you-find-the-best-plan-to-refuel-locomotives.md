Via the [INFORMS](http://www.informs.org/) newsletter, I found out this cool competition (trains and analytics, how much cooler can it get?): can you find the best plan to refuel the locomotives of a railroad company?  

> Create a cost-effective plan to fuel the locomotives that power a railroad's trains. Specify how many fuel trucks to contract at each yard and how much fuel to dispense into the locomotives of trains that run over a specified time horizon. Ensure that no locomotive runs out of fuel en route between yards. Sounds easy? We'll see about that!    

Learn more about the challenge at the [competition website](http://www.informs-ras.org/Problem.htm), and **register by June 15**, for glory, bragging rights, a shot at a first prize of $2,500 â€“ and help spare some poor chaps an unpleasant day:
