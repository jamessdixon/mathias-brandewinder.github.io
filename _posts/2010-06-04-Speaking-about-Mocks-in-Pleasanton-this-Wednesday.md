I am very honored that the East Bay chapter of the Bay Area .Net user group will have me as a speaker this upcoming Wednesday. I’ll be talking “For Those About to Mock”, about Mocks and Stubs in .Net, after a presentation of the unit testing features of Visual Studio by [Deborah Kurata](http://msmvps.com/blogs/DeborahK/) – an apt opening topic, if you ask me.  

You can find [more information about this event here](http://www.baynetug.org/DesktopModules/DetailXEvents.aspx?ItemID=435&mid=143); Hope to see you on Wednesday!
