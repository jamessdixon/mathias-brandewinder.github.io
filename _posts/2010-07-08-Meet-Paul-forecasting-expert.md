A new method of forecasting has been brought to my attention: [Paul](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/06/paul-the-octopus-stuns-ge_n_636118.html). Paul is an English-born octopus, currently living in Germany, and has been predicting with [high accuracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Octopus#The_2010_FIFA_World_Cup) the results of the German soccer team, by picking between two boxes marked with the flag of the two competing teams:

How unlikely is it that Paul would have such a string of correct forecasts? Pretty unlikely. If you assume that Paul’s picks were completely random, with a 50% chance of correctly calling the winner, the probability of making 11 good calls out of 12 comes down to 0.29%. Does this mean Paul is the next big thing in forecasting? It’s possible, but I don’t think so (this said with all due respect to Paul and his skills). Leonard Mlodinow, in his excellent book, [The Drunkard's Walk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307275175?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwclearlines-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307275175), makes the following comment:  

> This example illustrates an important point: even with data significant at, say, the 3 percent level, if you test 100 nonpsychic people for psychic abilities […], you ought to expect a few people to show up as psychic.

In other words, if a phenomenon is random, you should typically see the “average” case regularly, but you **should** also see highly unlikely cases happen from time to time – observing such a rare occurrence doesn’t contradict the randomness of the phenomenon. Or, in the words of the French poet Mallarmé, [Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_Coup_de_D%C3%A9s_Jamais_N'Abolira_Le_Hasard_(Mallarm%C3%A9)) (A throw of the Dice will Never Abolish Chance).
