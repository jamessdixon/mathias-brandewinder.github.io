Found on [Epic Win FTW](http://epicwinftw.com/2010/07/13/awesome-photos-oh-excel-is-good-for-something/) â€“ The Sparklines of Excel 2010 are cool, but this is an Epic Win indeed. Pretty amazing, and another shining example of how Excel is used for lots of purposes, some of them probably never considered by Microsoft :)
