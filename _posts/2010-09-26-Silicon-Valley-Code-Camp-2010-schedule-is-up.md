The most awesome free developer event on the west coast is back again, and it looks like it will be even more awesome this year. The 5th edition of [Silicon Valley Code Camp](http://siliconvalley-codecamp.com) is taking place Saturday and Sunday Oct 9th and 10th, 2010, at Foothill College, in Los Altos Hill. There are 194 sessions, already over 1,600 registrations, with topics for all tastes - .NET, Java, Cloud Computing, Python, Javascript, mobile development, and more.  

The [**2010 schedule is up here**](http://siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx). I will be giving 2 talks, on [Test-Driven Development, and on Mocking](http://siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?ForceSortBySessionTime=true&AttendeeId=583). Both are on Sunday â€“ hope to see you there!
