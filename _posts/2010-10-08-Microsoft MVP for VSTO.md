![MVP Award]({{ site.url }}/assets/2010-10-08-MVP-award_thumb.jpg)  

I am very honored to announce that I have become a Microsoft MVP for VSTO, Visual Studio Tools for Office. I learnt the news last week, and I am still super excited. I also feel somewhat intimidated, with a new sense of responsibility towards the community. Thank you Microsoft, and thank you to the Community - Iâ€™ll try my best to keep it up, to do my part to keep the .NET community at large a lively one, and to share my experience with VSTO and the fun of .NET + Office with you guys!   In other news, I apologize for the blog slowdown lately. In addition to being super-busy with a project (VSTO), I have had some problems with blog hosting, which have prevented me from writing new material. Things seem to be back on track now, I am sorry if you experienced some 404 inconvenience!
