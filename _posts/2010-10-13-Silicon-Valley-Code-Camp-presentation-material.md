Thanks to all of you who attended my sessions on Mocking and on TDD at Silicon Valley Code Camp 2010; I had a great time presenting, in large part because you were awesome and asked great questions!  

I uploaded the slides and code for the [session on Mocks here]({{ site.url }}/downloads/IntroToMocks.zip). 

There wasn’t much “written” material for the TDD session, so I didn’t upload it. If someone wants it, let me know in the comments and I’ll add it, too.  

Feel free to let me know if there are things I could have done better in the comments below, and don’t forget to fill in your [evaluations on the Code Camp website]( http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/MyEvals.aspx). It’s very helpful for speakers, and… you can win an iPad, courtesy of Dice.com!  On a side note, hats off to [Peter Kellner](http://peterkellner.net/) and the whole crew of volunteers. Silicon Valley Code Camp gets bigger every year, and yet, the organization was flawless, and the whole event very fun. Congratulations!
