Just saw that [version 3.1 of Microsoft Solver Foundation](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/solverfoundation/archive/2011/09/12/microsoft-solver-foundation-v3-1-released.aspx) has been released. I haven’t had time to try it out yet, but the list of improvements looks promising. A better non linear solver, better MIP and MIQP – sounds like Santa has come early! And I am curious about the faster bindings with LINQ…
