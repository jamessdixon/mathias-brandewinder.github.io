title: More F# Tourism&#58; Europa F# 2014

Well, last year’s F# tour was so much fun, I figured I would try to do it again, in Europe this time. I am becoming quite fond of F# tourism: after all, what better way to discover a place than going there and meeting locals who happen to have at least one common interest – and spread the F# love in the process?

Anyways, if everything goes according to plan, I should be visiting F# communities in 7 different countries in 6 weeks :) As an aside, if you are running a meetup/user group that is somewhat on my way, have a couch I can crash on, and would like me to stop by, ping me on twitter. I can’t make promises (obviously the schedule is a bit tight already), but if can, I will.

One thing I find pretty exciting is that all of a sudden, conferences are starting to have very nice F# and functional programming offerings. In particular, huge props to:

Build Stuff in Vilnius: the conference last year was fantastic, fun, diverse, stimulating, and just a great atmosphere. And the F#/functional lineup this year is awesome. Trust me, if you can go – just go, you won’t regret it.
NDC London: when you see a major conference like NDC putting together one entire track solely dedicated to functional programming, you know something is happening. I am really stoked – at that point, I don’t see why I would attend conferences without a solid functional track. My daily work is primarily functional, and in my (biased) opinion, functional is where a lot of the innovation is happening lately. So… thanks to NDC for bridging the gap, and putting together a program that I can enjoy!
At any rate, here is the current plan – stay tuned for updates and more details, and hope to see you somewhere along the way!
