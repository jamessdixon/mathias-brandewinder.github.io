Well, we are in the last hours of 2014, and I am nearly recovered from the craziness that was the [F# Europa Tour 2014](http://brandewinder.com/2014/10/12/More-fsharp-Tourism-Europa-Tour-2014/), so here we go – the Tour, in cold, hard facts (after all, I am a numbers’ guy):

* 40 days of travelling across Europe.
* 16 talks.
* 5 workshops (about 50 hours total).
* 9 countries.
* 6991 miles (11,250 kilometers) travelled, roughly (this is straight-line city to city, so the actual number is probably a good deal larger).
* 14 hours of bus.
* roughly 50 hours of train.
* roughly 28 hours of plane.
* 12 cities visited (and spoken at!).
* I lost track of how many gallons of beer were ingested. This is big data.
* 500 attendees? Maybe more? See previous data point.
* Delivered hundreds of shiny [fsharp.org](www.fsharp.org) stickers to F# Communities across Europe. Btw, in case you didn't hear - the F# Software Foundation is now a full-fledged, legally established entity, and [YOU can be a member. Check it out!](http://foundation.fsharp.org/join)

Now for the important qualitative questions:

* Where did I eat the best bacon? This came as a surprise to me, but I have to say, the bacon I ate in Dublin, Ireland was amazing. Twice.
* Where does one find the best beer in Europe? This is a hard one – I had a chance to sample great beers from all over the place. I would say, Munich and its Biergarten rules, but the live beers at BuildStuff in Vilnius, Lithuania, were a very nice surprise.
* What’s the weirdest thing I ate? This one goes to Norway and its [Lutefisk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutefisk), a traditional Christmas fish dish. It’s definitely a regional specialty, as in, a specialty which didn’t expand beyond a limited regional area, for good reasons. For the record, I actually enjoyed it!
* What was the worst travelling mistake? Booking a last minute train ticket from Paris to Aarhus, Denmark, to realize in the train that instead of a nice sleeping car, I would be spending 22 hours sitting in a train with no food on board.
* Biggest scare: every person who has given a talk will tell you, relying on the internet and anything live in a presentation is a rookie mistake. This is great advice, which is why I completely ignored it. It all worked just fine, but learning that Azure had been down for a couple of hours, right before a talk at BuildStuff which 100% required a live deployment to Azure to work, did give me some cold sweat.
Would I do it again? In a heartbeat! It was a bit crazy, and definitely exhausting, but a ton of fun. All of you who helped out making this happen, from the bottom of my heart, thank you! The F# Community is absolutely fantastic, packed with energy and a good, friendly vibe, and everywhere I went felt like family. You all kept me going, so again, thank you (you know who you are)! In the meanwhile, I wish you all a happy year 2015 ahead, let’s make that one even better than 2014, and I hope to see many of you again this year! And, as always, feel free to [ping me on Twitter as @brandewinder](https://twitter.com/brandewinder/).
