## Hi there! I am Mathias Brandewinder.

Thanks for visiting! If you ended up on this page, it's probably because you want to know more about me, so here we go.

I have been writing code professionally for the past 10 years or so, and enjoying most of it. I used to work mostly in C#, until I discovered F# and fell in love with it. My original background has little to do with programming: in a past life, I studied economics, and operations research. I am interested (among many things) in applied math in general, and machine learning and decision theory in particular. What else? I am a Microsoft .NET / F# MVP, I wrote a book, ["Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers"](http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Projects-NET-Developers/dp/1430267674/?tag=mathias-brandewinder-20), I enjoy Muay Thai, I like people and Community building, and I have a tendency to get very absorbed in projects of highly variable usefulness.
